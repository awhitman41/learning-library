# Access Bobby's Book Application and Explore Verrazzano and Other Consoles

## Introduction

In Lab 3, we deployed the Bobby's Book application. In this lab, we will access the application and verify that it is working. Later, we will explore the Verrazzano and Grafana consoles.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Access the Bobby's Book application.
* Explore the Verrazzano console.
* Explore the Grafana console.

### Prerequisites

<if type="freetier">
* Run Lab 1, which creates an OKE cluster on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
</if>

<if type="livelabs">
* Run Lab 1, which configure kubectl to access an OKE cluster on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
</if>

* Run Lab 2, which installs Verrazzano on a Kubernetes cluster.
* Run Lab 3, which deploys the Bobby's Book application.
* You should have a text editor, where you can paste the commands and URLs and modify them, as per your environment. Then you can copy and paste the modified commands for running them in the *Cloud Shell*.
* We recommend to use Firefox for opening the URLs of Bobby's Books application, Verrazano, Grafana and Kiali Console. However, if you want to use Chrome, then you need to use the undocumented 'thisisunsafe' workaround to allow chrome to accept the cert.

## Task 1: Access the Bobby's Book application

1. We need an `EXTERNAL_IP` address through which we can access the Bobby's Book application. To get the `EXTERNAL_IP` address of the istio-ingressgateway service, copy the following command and paste it in the *Cloud Shell*.

      ```bash
      <copy> kubectl get service \
      -n "istio-system" "istio-ingressgateway" \
      -o jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}; echo</copy>
      ```

   The output should be similar to the following:
      ```bash
         $ kubectl get service \
         > -n "istio-system" "istio-ingressgateway" \
         > -o jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}; echo
         XX.XX.XX.XX
      ```
2. To open the Robert's Book Store Home Page, copy the following URL and replace *XX.XX.XX.XX* with your *EXTERNAL_IP* address which we got in the last step, as shown in the following image.

      ```bash
      <copy>https://bobs-books.bobs-books.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io/</copy>
      ```

3. Click *Advanced*, as shown:

   ![Advanced](images/3.png " ")


4. Select *Proceed to bobs-books.bobs-books. EXTERNAL_IP .nip.io(unsafe)* to access the application. If you are the not getting this option for proceed, just type *thisisunsafe* without any space anywhere inside this chrome browser window. As you are typing in the chrome browser window, you can't see it, but as soon as you finish typing *thisisunsafe*, you can see application page immediately. You can find more details [here](https://verrazzano.io/latest/docs/faq/faq/#enable-google-chrome-to-accept-self-signed-verrazzano-certificates).

5. To open the Bobby's Book Store Home page, open a new tab and copy the following URL and replace *XX.XX.XX.XX* with your `EXTERNAL_IP` address, as shown in the following image.

      ```bash
      <copy>https://bobs-books.bobs-books.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io/bobbys-front-end/</copy>
      ```

   ![Bob bookstore](images/7.png " ")

   > Leave this page open  because we will use it in Lab 8.

6. To open the Bobby's Book Order Manager UI, open a new tab and copy the following URL and replace *XX.XX.XX.XX* with your *EXTERNAL_IP* address as shown in the following image.

      ```bash
      <copy>https://bobs-books.bobs-books.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io/bobs-bookstore-order-manager/orders</copy>
      ```

   ![order manager](images/8.png " ")

7. Go Back to the *Bobby's Books* page and let's purchase a book. Click *Books* as shown in the following image.

   ![Check out order](images/38.png " ")

8. Select the image for the *Twilight* Book, as shown in the following image.

   ![Purchase book](images/39.png " ")

9. First, click *Add to cart* and then *Checkout* as shown in the following image.

   ![Purchase book](images/40.png " ")

10. Enter the details for purchasing the book. For *Your State*, enter your two digit state code and then click *Submit Order*.

   ![Purchase book](images/42.png " ")
11. Go back to the *Order Manager* page and select the *Refresh* button to check if your order is successfully recorded in the order manager.

## Task 2: Explore the Verrazzano Console

Verrazzano installs several consoles. The endpoints for an installation are stored in the `Status` field of the installed Verrazzano Custom Resource.

1. You can get the endpoints for these consoles by using the following command:

      ```bash
      <copy>kubectl get vz -o jsonpath="{.items[].status.instance}" | jq .</copy>
      ```

   The output should be similar to the following:
      ```bash
      $ kubectl get vz -o jsonpath="{.items[].status.instance}" | jq .
      {
      "consoleUrl": "https://verrazzano.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "elasticUrl": "https://elasticsearch.vmi.system.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "grafanaUrl": "https://grafana.vmi.system.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "keyCloakUrl": "https://keycloak.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "kialiUrl": "https://kiali.vmi.system.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "kibanaUrl": "https://kibana.vmi.system.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "prometheusUrl": "https://prometheus.vmi.system.default.1XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "rancherUrl": "https://rancher.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io"
      }
      $
      ```
    Click the links to open the *Verrazzano* Console.

2. Click *Advanced*.

   ![Advanced](images/14.png " ")

3. Select *Proceed to verrazzano default XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io(unsafe)*. If you are the not getting this option for proceed, just type *thisisunsafe* without any space. Do the same for opening other URLs of Verrazzano Consoles. You can find more details [here](https://verrazzano.io/latest/docs/faq/faq/#enable-google-chrome-to-accept-self-signed-verrazzano-certificates).


   ![Proceed](images/15.png " ")

4. Because it redirects to the Keycloak console  URL for authentication, again on this page, click *Advanced*.

   ![Keycloak Authentication](images/16.png " ")

5. Select *Proceed to Keycloak default XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io(unsafe)*. If you are the not getting this option for proceed, just type *thisisunsafe* without any space.

   ![Proceed](images/17.png " ")

6. Now we need the user name and password for the Verrazzano console. *Username* is *verrazzano* and to find out the password, go back to the *Cloud Shell* and paste the following command to find out the password for the *Verrazzano Console*.

      ```bash
      <copy>kubectl get secret --namespace verrazzano-system verrazzano -o jsonpath={.data.password} | base64 --decode; echo</copy>
      ```

   The output should be similar to the following:
      ```bash
      $ kubectl get secret --namespace verrazzano-system verrazzano -o jsonpath={.data.password} | base64 --decode; echo
      aBsNxxZnl1ea3Vzp
      $
      ```

7. Copy the password and go back to the browser, where the *Verrazzano Console* is open.

   ![Verrazzano login](images/36.png " ")

8. Paste the password in the *Password* field and enter *verrazzano* as *Username* and then click *Sign In*.

   ![SignIn](images/19.png " ")

   In the Home Page of the Verrazzano Console, you can see *System Telemetry* and because we installed the *Development Profile* of Verrazzano, you can see it in the *General Information* section.

   ![Home Page](images/20.png " ")
